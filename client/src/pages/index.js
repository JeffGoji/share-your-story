                    Medical errors account for as many as 251,000 deaths per year as well as permanent injuries to the survivors of medical malpractice. Unfortunately the survivors are often not given a chance to speak about there experiences, and we aim to change that as well as support them in the recovery process and give them a chance at justice and making their voices heard.
